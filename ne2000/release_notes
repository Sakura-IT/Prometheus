prm-rtl8029.device history

0.19 (06.09.2001)

  FIXED: Interrupt server routine - should no more lock up with long
         files transferred by FTP.

  ADDED: AbortIO() proper handling.


0.20 (09.09.2001)

  ADDED: Raw packet support in CMD_WRITE and S2_BROADCAST (it was already done
         for CMD_READ).


0.21 (09.09.2001)

  ADDED: Support for PROMISCUOUS and EXCLUSIVE mode per unit.


0.22 (12.09.2001)

  FIXED: Bug in SendPacket() caused every not SANA2IOF_RAW packet had 14
         bytes of trash appended at the end.

  FIXED: Bug in InitUnit() - UnitData pointer was not initialized at
         first device opening.


0.23 (17.09.2001)

  ADDED: Support for S2_GETGLOBALSTATS command.

  FIXED: S2_ONLINE now returns error when called before
         S2_CONFIGINTERFACE.

  FIXED: Write and read queues are now flushed with S2ERR_OUTOFSERVICE
         on S2_OFFLINE command.

  FIXED: Write and read requests are rejected with S2ERR_OUTOFSERVICE if
         the device is in offline state.
	
      
1.0 (16.09.2002)

  ADDED: Support for PRM_BoardOwner tag of prometheus.library.
	
      
1.1 (04.10.2002)

  FIXED: S2_GETSTATIONADDRES returns MAC address from card ROM in
	 ios2_DstAddr, and address set by software in ios2_SrcAddr.
	 
  FIXED: S2_CONFIGINTERFACE allows for overriding hardware address.
  
  ADDED: S2_CONFIGINTERFACE rejects 00:00:00:00:00:00 and FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
	 addresses.

  FIXED: Added calls to HardwareReset() and HardwareInit() fix the problem
	 with bad first read of hardware address after power on.

1.2 (06.10.2002)

  FIXED: Device was added to the system list even if opening of libraries
	 failed. It fixes hangups when trying to open the device with 1.x
	 prometheus.library (the device requires 2.x).
	 
1.3 (11.11.2002)

  FIXED: A loop in interrupt handler could be leaved in spite of pending
	 interrupts. It could lead to lost packets in heavy network traffic and
	 slow CPU.
